                    <h4>Some things I believe:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Knowledge is the greatest investment</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you want to be great at something, you have to do it every single day</li>
                            <li>Most people would rather ask questions, debate, etc</li>
                            <li>Most decisions are two way doors and you are often times rewarded for taking the initiative</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>The value of human agency is rising</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>AI will be highly disruptive and punish complacency</li>
                            <li>At the same time, it'll dramatically increase individual productivity</li>
                            <li>It's unclear how long long human agency will be valuable, which makes it doubly important now</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Interests:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Philosophy, particularly that of Nozick, Plato, Hobbes, and Nietzsche</li>
                        <li>Economics, I found it gave me an excellent framework for thinking about the world in a systemic way</li>
                        <li>Art, including literature, painting, and film. My favorite movie is Barry Lyndon, and my favorite book is Journey to the End of the Night</li>
                        <li>My major area of interest is currently AI, probably because it's an intersection of all three</li>
