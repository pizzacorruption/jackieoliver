            <h4>Some things about me:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I grew up in Virginia Beach, VA</li>
                <li>Studied Economics and Philosophy at the University of Virginia (I also minored in Chinese!)</li>
                <li>I currently work at Haptica Sensorics, giving machines a sense of touch!</li>

        <section id="beliefs">
            <h4>Some things I believe:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Knowledge is the greatest investment</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you want to be great at something, you have to do it every single day</li>
                    <li>Most people would rather ask questions, debate, etc</li>
                    <li>Most decisions are two way doors and you are often times rewarded for taking the initiative</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The value of human agency is rising</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI will be highly disruptive and punish complacency</li>
                    <li>At the same time, it'll dramatically increase individual productivity</li>
                    <li>It's unclear how long long human agency will be valuable, which makes it doubly important now
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="interests">
            <h4>Interests:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Philosophy, particularly that of Nozick, Plato, Hobbes, and Nietzsche</li>
                <li>Economics, I found it gave me an excellent framework for thinking about the world in a systemic way
                </li>
                <li>Art, including literature, painting, and film. My favorite movie is Barry Lyndon, and my favorite
                    book is Journey to the End of the Night</li>
                <li>My major area of interest is currently AI, probably because it's an intersection of all three</li>
            </ul>
